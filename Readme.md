**Help Full for New Bignners, 


**Any Developer # # # Has This Questions in mind regarding Python.

Q.)Is Python worth learning?
O.)Why you should learn Python today.
Q.)What makes Python so popular? 
O.)Should you stop what you’re doing and start learning Python right now?


**Let me give you some reasons to learn Python:-

1. You Can Use Python for Pretty Much Anything(Data science, Web development, etc.)
2. Python Is Widely Used in Data Science.(Pandas, NumPy, etc.)
3. Python Pays Well(Average $103,500 approx. Per Year / Rs 78 approx. LPA)
4. Demand for Python Developers Is High (And Growing)
5. Python Saves Time(takes a lot less time to code)
6. Python Is Beginner Friendly(clean and readable syntax)
7. All the Big Names Use Python(Facebook, Google,etc)
8. Python Has an Amazing Ecosystem(built-in functionality)

**My Opinion -> I definitely recommend you start with C then continue with C ++ and from there to Python. From C and C++, We get the basic concepts of programming and oops cleared. It will make us learning And understanding Python more easily. 

**Benefits of using Python

For me, the most important benefit of learning Python was learning about the different open source libraries it has to offer. In particular, libraries such as pandas, that allow social scientists to carry out data analysis. 
In addition, using a programming language in social research opens the door to the analysis of big data, which is increasingly becoming available in the modern digital world. 


**Would I recommend Python to other researchers?

Yes! All in all, my experience learning Python has been fulfilling and empowering. Learning Python truly makes me feel like I am able to subject the machine to do amazing tasks for me, rather than using software with a third-party user interface. I couldn’t imagine that one dull day could turn into such an eye-opener for my research.


Thanks For Reading.
